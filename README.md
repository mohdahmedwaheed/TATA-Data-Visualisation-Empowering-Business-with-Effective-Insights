### Presenting Insights and Analysis
Participants discover how to communicate their findings and analyses clearly.
Task Breakdown
## Task 1: Defining the Business Scenario
In this task, you will learn how to predict the questions that your business leaders will need addressed.
### Background Information: 
An online retail company has engaged you as a consultant to evaluate their data and provide insights beneficial to both the CEO and CMO. The organization has been thriving, and management is eager to analyze the primary factors contributing to their revenue so they can strategically plan for the upcoming year. They are interested in examining metrics from both operational and marketing perspectives, as well as demographic data.
Management aims to expand the business and seeks guidance on high-performing areas to maintain focus on successful strategies. A meeting with the CEO and CMO is scheduled for next month, during which you need to present relevant analytics and insights that will aid in evaluating current business performance and suggest metrics for making expansion decisions.
To prepare, draft questions that you believe will be significant for both the CEO and CMO. This preparation will serve as a roadmap as you develop your presentation. Ensure that your questions encompass both quantitative and qualitative aspects. You have been provided with a dataset in the resources below; review this data carefully, noting what information is available, what insights can be derived, and what is pertinent to each executive's perspective. Formulate a total of eight questions—four tailored for the CEO and four for the CMO—ensuring that each set reflects their unique viewpoints on business decisions.
## Task 2: Selecting Appropriate Visuals
In this task, you will learn which visuals are most effective in specific scenarios.
### Background Information: 
The CEO and CMO have requested visuals regarding metrics they wish to analyze for the online retail store. You will gather their requirements and propose the type of visual best suited for each scenario. Senior management seeks to understand their business performance and identify key strengths while also pinpointing growth opportunities that could enhance revenue in the future.
You will receive multiple visualization requests from the CEO, requiring you to select visuals that convey data and insights clearly. This task is crucial for senior management, as any misrepresentation could lead to misunderstandings or poor decision-making. Therefore, it is essential to choose appropriate visuals for each dataset.
## Task 3: Developing Impactful Visuals
In this task, you will apply your understanding by creating visuals based on business scenarios.
### Background Information: 
After meeting with the CEO and CMO, they have finalized their requirements and would like you to provide analysis along with visuals that address their inquiries. Both executives aim to understand how they can utilize data to make informed decisions regarding their expansion strategy. They want insights into trends broken down by various categories to clarify how revenue is generated and identify key factors influencing the online store's performance.
You will need to ensure that the data used is clean—free from inaccuracies such as negative quantities or erroneous unit prices—before creating visuals using either Tableau or Power BI. Regardless of which tool you choose, your results should facilitate effective decision-making for their expansion strategy.
## Task 4: Presenting Insights Effectively
Now it's time to share your findings with the CEO and CMO.
### Background Information: 
They are interested in your analytical process, particularly how you managed data cleanup and visualization phases. Clearly articulate your thought process and conclusions drawn from your analysis of all four questions posed earlier.
To complete this task, develop a script for a video presentation summarizing your findings based on the four questions they asked and the visuals created in previous tasks. Your presentation should cover your entire process—from initial data loading through cleanup steps—demonstrating thoroughness in providing accurate analysis. Focus on delivering information that aligns with their interests in expansion opportunities.
